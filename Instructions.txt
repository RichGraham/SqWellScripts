====Setting up simulations====

==== Analysing results ====

____doBoth.sh____
Presents sqWell output data
Runs the following: 
 - CollateClip: averages over block data, clipping out early results if desired.
 - blockVary: computes the upper and low range explored during a block
Plots results via xmgrace
Usage  :  doBoth [int matchPoint][int Maximum energy][input filename][int averaging start point]
Example:  doBoth.sh 0 100 inputFiles/N10TestRun.dat 1

during a block


====Building====

Run >./makeAll.sh icc <--compiler name (optional) defaults to gcc
