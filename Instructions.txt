====Setting up simulations====
* sqWellCp.sh: Creates a copy of an input file with a new name and new output folders

* setupRun.sh (main distro): Generates output folders and hpc submission scripts  
   	- checkOutputFolder.sh: Checks input file and output folder names are the same
	- createDirs.sh (main distro): Creates required output folders 

* quickRestart

* clipQuad: Attempts to create a biasing function that's localised around the density of states'bottle-neck

==== Analysing results ====

* doBoth.sh: Averages and presents sqWell output data
	-collateClip
	-showAll.sh
	-blockVary

* batchOutput: Compares the output of multiple runs, to check reproducibility.
	-doBoth.sh
* batchAverage: Averages over the output of multiple runs, to improve accuracy.
	-doBoth.sh

* multiAverage        

* dosMapping: takes an existing free energy landscape and maps it to a new temperature via density of states.
	Also computes 1/T vs E (via DOS)


                                                            

====Building====
cd  ~/source/SqWellScripts
./makeAll.sh icc <â€”compiler name (optional) defaults to gcc
