====Setting up simulations====
* sqWellCp.sh: Creates a copy of an input file with a new name and new output folders

* setupRun.sh (main distro): Generates output folders and hpc submission scripts  
   	- checkOutputFolder.sh: Checks input file and output folder names are the same
	- createDirs.sh (main distro): Creates required output folders 

* quickRestart

* clipQuad: Attempts to create a biasing function that's localised around the density of states'bottle-neck

==== Analysing results ====

* doBoth.sh: Averages and presents sqWell output data
	-collateClip: averages over temperatures individually for a single run
	-blockVary : examines each block and finds the mean n_SW and the max/min value that has at least 10 visits.
	-showAll.sh : plots summary data for a run to allow checking and diagnosis of issues

* batchOutput: Compares the output of multiple runs, to check reproducibility.
	-doBoth.sh

* batchAverage: Averages over the output of multiple runs [uses the same .list files as batchOutput].
	-doBoth.sh
	-multiAverage: 
This code outputs the following files:
	§ <NAME>.list.dat : The FE barrier at Tinterest (from Tinterest)
	§ <NAME>.list.dat.all : [N columns] The FE barrier at Tinterest (from each temperature)
	§ <NAME>.list.dat.FE.stc :  The FE barrier at Tinterest (stitched together using the best available temperature)
	§ <NAME>.list.dat.invT.all : [N columns] 1/T vs n_E (from each temperature)
	§ <NAME>.list.dat.invT.stc : 1/T vs n_E (stitched together using the best available temperature)


* dosMapping: takes an existing free energy landscape and maps it to a new temperature via density of states.
	Also computes 1/T vs E (via DOS)
                                        

====Building====
cd  ~/source/SqWellScripts
./makeAll.sh icc <—compiler name (optional) defaults to gcc
